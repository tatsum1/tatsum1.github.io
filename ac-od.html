		<h3>Plot</h3>
		<p class="plot">As a child, Kassandra was presented with the broken Spear of Leonidas, an Isu weapon, as an heirloom by her mother. Because of her prestigious lineage, great hopes were placed upon her to live up to the strength and valour of Leonidas. Her step-father, Nikolaos, would often train her in hopes that she would follow in his footsteps. In 446 BCE the Pythia Praxithea at Sanctuary of Delphi prophesied that Kassandra's younger brother, the baby Alexios, would lead to the fall of Sparta in the future. In order to prevent this, Alexios was to be sacrificed at Mount Taygetos, despite Myrrine's plea for Nikolaos to stop it. As a priest was about to drop Alexios, Kassandra attempted to stop the sacrifice, but instead pushed the priest and Alexios to their apparent deaths. Kassandra was condemned as a traitor to Sparta, leading her step-father to execute her by dropping her off the mountains, though it was obvious he was remorseful in doing so.Kassandra, however, survived the fall, and escaped to the beach with the spear. Refusing to be found by the Spartans, Kassandra fled out to the open seas, with an eagle following her. A storm later turned Kassandra's boat overboard and she woke up on the beaches of Kephallonia. There, she was greeted by Markos, who took her under his wing and tasked her to do errands for him.</p>
