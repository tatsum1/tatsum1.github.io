		<h3>Plot</h3>
		<p class="plot">Jack was born and raised in the Whitechapel district of London, where he lived alongside his mother until she was murdered by Crawford Starrick's Templar lackies. Traumatized by her death, Jack was placed in Lambeth Asylum, where poor treatment and negligence only further aggravated his mental instability. Following the death of Starrick in 1868, he was liberated from the asylum and brought into the fold of the Assassin Order by Jacob Frye to be trained among a selection of new initiates.Around 1873, he traveled with Jacob and the other initiates to India in order to learn the fear tactics of the Indian Brotherhood, a group that Jacob's sister, Evie Frye, had joined following her marriage to Henry Green and subsequent relocation. Upon returning to London, Jack began to develop an extremist view of the Assassins' mission, believing that the Assassins must be feared by the citizens, killing innocents if necessary. Eventually in 1888, with the help of several dangerous criminals, Jack usurped control of the Rooks from Jacob, killing anyone sent to deter him.</p>
