		<h3>Plot</h3>
		<p class="plot">The plot of the game begins in the present day with Desmond, his father William, Rebecca Crane, and Shaun Hastings finding the Grand Temple in a cave in Turin, New York. Using an Ezio's Apple of Eden to access the structure, Desmond activates a large portion of the equipment, as well as a timer indicating when the Second Disaster is predicted to occur, on December 21, 2012. His mind then falls into a fugue state, in which he relives some significant memories of his ancestor, Haytham Kenway.During a production at the London Theatre Royal, Haytham murders a man named Miko and steals a medallion which he and his associates believe allows access to a storehouse for "those who came before". After Haytham returns with the medallion, he is dispatched to the British American colonies to find the storehouse.After preventing an attempt by crewman Louis Mills to turn him over to a trailing ship while on board the Providence, Haytham arrives in Boston. There, he is tasked with gathering together five men faithful to his cause: Charles Lee, William Johnson, Thomas Hickey, Benjamin Church and Jonathan Pitcairn. In the process, he kills a slave trader named Silas Thatcher and frees a large group of Kanien'keh√°:ka tribespeople, believing it will make then amicable to his cause.</p>
