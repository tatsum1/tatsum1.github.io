		<h3>Plot</h3>
		<p class="plot">In 2014, a Helix user explored the memories of a Templar in the service of Jacques de Molay. The memory takes place in 13 October 1307, in the Temple in Paris, which was being attacked by the forces of King Philip the Fair. Alerted by the ensuing battle, Jacques tasked his advisor to hide the Sword of Eden and the Codex Pater Intellectus. Running through the battlefield, the advisor took notice of an Assassin, Thomas de Carneillon. After a sword fight with Thomas, the advisor returned the Sword and Codex to their resting place in the Temple. As the advisor left the room, he noticed Jacques had been captured. However, before he could rescue the Grand Master, the advisor was stopped by Thomas, who killed him with his Hidden Blade. Seven years later, Jacques and his affiliates were set to be burned at the stake. Before perishing, Jacques cursed the Pope and King overseeing his execution. With his death, the Templar Order was publicly disbanded.Suddenly, the memory was interrupted by the transmission of an Assassin, who introduced herself as Bishop. She explained to them that they were being manipulated by Abstergo to sift through memories, following which she asked them to experience an unsequenced set of Arno Dorian's memories as an introduction to the Assassins and Templars.</p>
