		<h3>Biography</h3>
		<p class="plot">Bayek was born in Siwa, Egypt in 85 BCE to the Medjay, Sabu, and his wife, Ahmose. When he was a young child, a group led by a grave robber known as Menna had attacked his family home. Most of them were killed by Sabu, but his mother bravely defended him as well. Bayek became a close friend of Hepzefa, a fellow Siwan, and Kensa, a Nubian girl who trained Bayek in hunting. He was also well acquainted with Menehet, a priest of Sekhmet in Yamu whose children treated Bayek as a loving uncle. Bayek also occasionally raced against Sennefer, who later left Siwa and live in Kanopos under the name Claridas.In 70 BCE, Bayek lived in Siwa with his parents. At this time, he was also in a relationship with Aya of Alexandria, a Greek girl whom he adored. Bayek's father did not approve of their relationship as he knew that Aya's dream was to settle in Alexandria, and he feared that her mixed heritage would corrupt his teachings. Bayek had started training to be a Medjay, a protector of the community. A messenger arrived and relayed a message to Sabu. He briefly spoke with Rabiah. Sabu elected to leave Siwa without giving a reason other than it being safer for Siwa that he left. After discussing his decision with Rabiah and Ahmose, Bayek chose to follow his father and goes off in search of him. He initially travelled to the city of Zawty to find the messenger who had informed Sabu. In doing so he meets Tuta a boy street urchin, who ultimately misled Bayek resulting in his purses being stolen. After chasing down the thief across rooftops, Bayek is nearly strangled to death by Tuta's father, Paneb. He was saved by Aya, who had followed him. She knocked out Paneb and the three of them including Tuta escape to Thebes.Several years passed, and Sabu continued to train Bayek as a Medjay. In turn, Aya was trained by Bayek. They spent years training on the run across many villages. Eventually, Bayek asked for Aya's hand in marriage. She refused, citing that being a Medjay wife would be harsh and that she still dreamed to live and work in the Library of Alexandria. She elected to leave the training as her aunt had taken ill. As she travelled back to Siwa she was set upon by horse thieves at a watering hole. She was able to hold her own until Bion came to her aide. Unknowingly, Aya had led Bion right to their training camp. Once they arrived, Bion let loose arrows that hit Sabu only to slice Bayek's stomach with a blade. All three men were ultimately injured in the ensuing battle, leading Sabu to push Bayek into a nearby river to save him. As a result, Sabu was struck down and killed by Bion. After Sabu is killed, Bayek falls unconscious and is swept away safely by the river.</p>
