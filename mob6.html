		<h3>Gameplay</h3>
		<p class="plot">Assassin's Creed: Multiplayer Rearmed is a 2-dimensional top-down touch-based multiplayer game which pits up to 4 players against each other to play a five minute competitive match identical to the Animi Training Program's Wanted mode, if the players are connected via Apple's Game Center via WiFi or 3G. Alternatively, a 1-on-1 match may be played if two players connect via a Bluetooth connection. There is also an offline practice mode in which the player practices against an AI opponent.The player's target is displayed on the top left corner of their screen, and an arrow which acts as a compass points towards them. The arrow fades as the target gets closer, and disappears when the target is near the player. An overall list of players and their scores are displayed on the top right corner of the screen. On the top of the screen in the center is a timer which counts down from five minutes. The bottom right of the screen shows which perks the player is using, and when they will be available for use. The bottom left corner of the screen is the home button, which forces the player to the main menu, although it cancels any XP or florins which would have been gained from the match.</p>
