		<h3>Plot</h3>
		<p class="plot">The episode began with Ratonhnhaké:ton asleep near a riverbank in the Frontier, wearing an animal spirit outfit. Ratonhnhaké:ton was then awoken by his mother, Kaniehtí:io, who alerted him to a threat in the forest. He followed her, questioning why she was alive and what had happened. Eventually, they came upon a Bluecoat patrol attacking the villagers. After dispatching the Bluecoats, a woman warned Kaniehtí:io that King George was looking for her. Kaniehtí:io led Ratonhnhaké:ton to the top of the hill, while he questioned the surroundings, and why the woman referred to George Washington as "King".As they reached the top of the hill, they witnessed a group of Bluecoats forcing the Concord townspeople into the church and barricading the door. The Bluecoat leader demanded that the people inform him of the location of Kaniehtí:io. As they insisted that they did not know her location, the Bluecoats set fire to the church. Ratonhnhaké:ton and his mother quickly ambushed Washington's men, and liberated the townspeople, only for a cannonball blast to kill the group before they could escape.</p>
